<h3>Compilation:</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>OCRA will load your script (using <tt>Kernel#load</tt>) and build the
executable when it exits.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Your program should ¡®require¡¯ all necessary files when invoked without
arguments, so OCRA can detect all dependencies.</p>
</li><li>
<p>DLLs are detected automatically but only those located in your Ruby
installation are included.</p>
</li><li>
<p>.rb files will become console applications. .rbw files will become windowed
application (without a console window popping up). Alternatively, use the
¡°<tt>--console</tt>¡± or ¡°<tt>--windows</tt>¡± options.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Running your application:</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The ¡®current working directory¡¯ is not changed by OCRA when running your
application. You must change to the installation or temporary directory
yourself. See also below.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the application is running, the OCRA_EXECUTABLE environment variable
points to the .exe (with full path).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The temporary location of the script can be obtained by inspected the $0
variable.</p>
</li><li>
<p>OCRA does not set up the include path. Use <tt>$:.unshift
File.dirname($0)</tt> at the start of your script if you need to ¡®require¡¯
additional source files from the same directory as your main script.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Pitfalls:</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Avoid modifying load paths at run time. Specify load paths using -I or
RUBYLIB if you must, but don¡¯t expect OCRA to preserve them for runtime.
OCRA may pack sources into other directories than you expect.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you use .rbw files or the <tt>--windows</tt> option, then check that
your application works with rubyw.exe before trying with OCRA.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Avoid absolute paths in your code and when invoking OCRA.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS:</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Windows</p>
</li><li>
<p>Working Ruby installation. <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> is tested with
RubyInstaller 1.8.7p374, 1.9.3p545, and 2.0.0p481 (32 and 64 bit).</p>
</li><li>
<p>MinGW Installation (when working with the source code only)</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Stand-alone version</h3>

<p>Get ocrasa.rb from <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=8185">rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=8185</a>.
Requires nothing but a working Ruby installation on Windows.</p>

<h2>TECHNICAL DETAILS</h2>

<p>OCRA first runs the target script in order to detect any files that are
loaded and used at runtime (Using <tt>Kernel#require</tt> and
<tt>Kernel#load</tt>).</p>

<p>OCRA embeds everything needed to run a Ruby script into a single executable
file. The file contains the .exe stub which is compiled from C-code, and a
custom opcode format containing instructions to create directories, save
files, set environment variables and run programs. The OCRA script
generates this executable and the instructions to be run when it is
launched.</p>

<p>When executed, the OCRA stub extracts the Ruby interpreter and your scripts
into a temporary directory. The directory will contains the same directory
layout as your Ruby installlation. The source files for your application
will be put in the ¡®src¡¯ subdirectory.</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>Any code that is loaded through <tt>Kernel#require</tt> when your script is
executed will be included in the OCRA executable. Conditionally loaded code
will not be loaded and included in the executable unless the code is
actually run when OCRA invokes your script. Otherwise, OCRA won¡¯t know
about it and will not include the source files.</p>

<p>RubyGems are handled specially. Whenever a file from a Gem is detected,
OCRA will attempt to include all the required files from that specific Gem,
expect some unlikely needed files such as readme¡¯s and other documentation.
This behaviour can be controlled by using the ¨Cgem-* options. Behaviour can
be changed for all gems or specific gems using ¨Cgem-*=gemname.</p>

<p>Libraries found in non-standard path (for example, if you invoke OCRA with
¡°ruby -I some/path¡±) will be placed into the site dir (lib/ruby/site_ruby).
Avoid changing <tt>$LOAD_PATH</tt> or <tt>$:</tt> from your script to
include paths outside your source tree, since OCRA may place the files
elsewhere when extracted into the temporary directory.</p>

<p>In case your script (or any of its dependencies) sets up autoloaded module
using <tt>Kernel#autoload</tt>, OCRA will automatically try to load them to
ensure that they are all included in the executable. Modules that doesn¡¯t
exist will be ignored (a warning will be logged).</p>

<p>Dynamic link libraries (.dll files, for example WxWidgets, or other source
files) will be detected and included by OCRA.</p>

<h3>Including libraries non-automatically</h3>

<p>If an application or framework is complicated enough that it tends to
confuse Ocra¡¯s automatic dependency resolution, then you can use other
means to specify what needs to be packaged with your app.</p>

<p>To disable automatic dependency resolution, use the ¨Cno-dep-run option;
with it, <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> will skip executing your program
during the build process. This on the other hand requires using ¨Cgem-full
option (see more below); otherwise <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> will not
include all the necessary files for the gems.</p>

<p>You will also probably need to use the ¨Cadd-all-core option to include the
Ruby core libraries.</p>

<p>If your app uses gems, then you can specify them in a Bundler (<a
href="http://gembundler.com">gembundler.com</a>) Gemfile, then use the
¨Cgemfile option to supply it to <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a>. <a
href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> will automatically include all gems specified,
and all their dependencies.</p>

<p>(Note: This assumes that the gems are installed in your system, <b>not</b>
locally packaged inside the app directory by ¡°bundle package¡±)</p>

<p>These options are particularly useful for packaging Rails applications. 
For example, to package a Rails 3 app in the directory ¡°someapp¡± and create
an exe named ¡°someapp.exe¡±, without actually running the app during the
build, you could use the following command:</p>

<pre>ocra someapp/script/rails someapp --output someapp.exe --add-all-core \
--gemfile someapp/Gemfile --no-dep-run --gem-full --chdir-first -- server</pre>

<p>Note the space between ¡°¨C¡± and ¡°server¡±! It¡¯s important; ¡°server¡± is an
argument to be passed to rails when the script is ran.</p>

<p>Rails 2 apps can be packaged similarly, though you will have to integrate
them with Bundler (<a
href="http://gembundler.com/rails23.html">gembundler.com/rails23.html</a>)
first.</p>

<h3>Gem handling</h3>

<p>By default, <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> includes all scripts that are
loaded by your script when it is run before packaging. <a
href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> detects which gems are using and includes any
additional non-script files from those gems, except trivial files such as
C/C++ source code, object files, READMEs, unit tests, specs, etc.</p>

<p>This behaviour can be changed by using the ¨Cgem-* options. There are four
possible modes:</p>

<pre>minimal: Include only loaded scripts
guess: Include loaded scripts and important files (DEFAULT)
all: Include all scripts and important files
full: Include all files</pre>

<p>If you find that files are missing from the resulting executable, try first
with ¨Cgem-all=gemname for the gem that is missing, and if that does not
work, try ¨Cgem-full=gemname. The paranoid can use ¨Cgem-full to include all
files for all required gems.</p>

<h3>Creating an installer for your application</h3>

<p>To make your application start up quicker, or to allow it to keep files in
its application directory between runs, or if you just want to make your
program seem more like a ¡°regular¡± Windows application, you can have <a
href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> generate an installer for your app with the free
Inno Setup software.</p>

<p>You will first have to download and install Inno Setup 5 or later, and also
add its directory to your PATH (so that <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> can
find the ISCC compiler program). Once you¡¯ve done that, you can use the
¨Cinnosetup option to <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> to supply an Inno Setup
script. Do not add any [Files] or [Dirs] sections to the script; <a
href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> will figure those out itself.</p>

<p>To continue the Rails example above, let¡¯s package the Rails 3 app into an
installer. Save the following as ¡°<tt>someapp.iss</tt>¡±:</p>

<pre>[Setup]
AppName=SomeApp
AppVersion=0.1
DefaultDirName={pf}\SomeApp
DefaultGroupName=SomeApp
OutputBaseFilename=SomeAppInstaller

[Icons]
Name: &quot;{group}\SomeApp&quot;; Filename: &quot;{app}\someapp.exe&quot;
Name: &quot;{group}\Uninstall SomeApp&quot;; Filename: &quot;{uninstallexe}&quot;</pre>

<p>Then, run <a href="Ocra.html">Ocra</a> with this command:</p>

<pre>ocra someapp/script/rails someapp --output someapp.exe --add-all-core \
--gemfile someapp/Gemfile --no-dep-run --gem-full --chdir-first --no-lzma \
--innosetup someapp.iss -- server</pre>

<p>If all goes well, a file named ¡°SomeAppInstaller.exe¡± will be placed into
the Output directory.</p>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<p>OCRA executables clear the RUBYLIB environment variable before your script
is launched. This is done to ensure that your script does not use load
paths from the end user¡¯s Ruby installation.</p>

<p>OCRA executables set the RUBYOPT environment variable to the value it had
when you invoked OCRA. For example, if you had ¡°RUBYOPT=rubygems¡± on your
build PC, OCRA ensures that it is also set on PC¡¯s running the executables.</p>

<p>OCRA executables set OCRA_EXECUTABLE to the full path of the executable,
for example</p>

<pre>ENV[&quot;OCRA_EXECUTABLE&quot;] # =&gt; C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe</pre>

<h3>Working directory</h3>

<p>The OCRA executable does not change the working directory when it is
launched, unless you use the ¡°<tt>--chdir-first</tt>¡± option.</p>

<p>You should not assume that the current working directory when invoking an
executable built with .exe is the location of the source script. It can be
the directory where the executable is placed (when invoked through the
Windows Explorer), the users¡¯ current working directory (when invoking from
the Command Prompt), or even <tt>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32</tt> when the
executable is invoked through a file association.</p>

<p>With the ¡°<tt>--chdir-first</tt>¡± option, the working directory will always
be the common parent directory of your source files. This should be fine
for most applications. However, if your application is designed to run from
the command line and take filenames as arguments, then you cannot use this
option.</p>

<p>If you wish to maintain the user¡¯s working directory, but need to ¡®require¡¯
additional Ruby scripts from the source directory, you can add the
following line to your script:</p>

<pre>$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.dirname($0)</pre>

<h3>Load path mangling</h3>

<p>Adding paths to <tt>$LOAD_PATH</tt> or <tt>$:</tt> at runtime is not
recommended. Adding relative load paths depends on the working directory
being the same as where the script is located (See above). If you have
additional library files in directories below the directory containing your
source script you can use this idiom:</p>

<pre>$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.join(File.dirname($0), 'path/to/script')</pre>

<h3>Detecting OCRA</h3>

<p>You can detect whether OCRA is currently building your script by looking
for the ¡®Ocra¡¯ constant. If it is defined, OCRA is currenly building the
executable from your script. For example, you can use this to avoid opening
a GUI window when compiling executables:</p>

<pre>app = MyApp.new
if not defined?(Ocra)
  app.main_loop
end</pre>

<h3>Additional files and resources</h3>

<p>You can add additional files to the OCRA executable (for example images) by
appending them to the command line. They should be placed in the source
directory with your main script (or a subdirectory).</p>

<pre>ocra mainscript.rb someimage.jpeg docs/document.txt</pre>

<p>This will create the following layout in the temporary directory when your
program is executed:</p>

<pre>src/mainscript.rb
src/someimage.jpeg
src/docs/document.txt</pre>

<p>Both files, directoriess and glob patterns can be specified on the command
line. Files will be added as-is. If a directory is specified, OCRA will
include all files found below that directory. Glob patterns (See Dir.glob)
can be used to specify a specific set of files, for example:</p>

<pre>ocra script.rb assets/**/*.png</pre>

<h3>Command Line Arguments</h3>

<p>To pass command line argument to your script (both while building and when
run from the resulting executable), specify them after a ¡°<tt>--</tt>¡±
marker. For example:</p>

<pre>ocra script.rb -- --some-options=value</pre>

<p>This will pass ¡°<tt>--some-options=value</tt>¡± to the script when build and
when running the executable. Any extra argument specified by the user when
invoking the executable will be appended after the compile-time arguments.</p>

<h3>Window/Console</h3>

<p>By default, OCRA builds console application from .rb-files and windowed
applications (without console window) from .rbw-files.</p>

<p>Ruby on Windows provides two executables: ruby.exe is a console mode
application and rubyw.exe is a windowed application which does not bring up
a console window when launched using the Windows Explorer. By default, or
if the ¡°<tt>--console</tt>¡± option is used, OCRA will use the console
runtime (ruby.exe). OCRA will automatically select the windowed runtime
when your script has the ¡°.rbw¡± extension, or if you specify the
¡°<tt>--windows</tt>¡± command line option.</p>

<p>If your application works in console mode but not in windowed mode, first
check if your script works without OCRA using rubyw.exe. A script that
prints to standard output (using puts, print etc.) will eventually cause an
exception when run with rubyw.exe (when the IO buffers run full).</p>

<p>You can also try wrapping your script in an exception handler that logs any
errors to a file:</p>

<pre>begin
  # your script here
rescue Exception =&gt; e
  File.open(&quot;except.log&quot;) do |f|
    f.puts e.inspect
    f.puts e.backtrace
  end
end</pre>
