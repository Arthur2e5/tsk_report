#Short description of each item
-Chinese translate of tsk_report
This is almostly full translate of text in tsk_report.
It can be currencly display translated Chinese, English and any other Japanese text from server to the console.
Not a perfect works but we will focus on it.

-English translate of tsk_report
As before, international edition official support two kind of language.
It can be correncly display translated English and any other Japanese text from server to the console.
Second priority to this project, so, since now it hasn't completed.

-AntiHjackSystem, server and client
Sometimes I'll make a mistake, add "tenco.info" and "static.tenco.info" to my router's blacklist
so I cannot use tenco anymore after that. In order to prevent this, I created this part of while tenco International project.
It can be let tsk_report keep its access to the tenco server even it has been blocked by anyone anonymous network administrator.
By the way, this situation is occurs sometimes in other place of Ch*na.
